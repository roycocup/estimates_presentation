## About me
* I don't have all the answers
* I have no formal training
* I just have done lots of reading
* Really searched for the right point of truth about agile and all the approaches thereafter (scrum, kanban, etc)

## Agile is not scrum
* What I'm going to show today is part of a much much larger set of information which may be essential
* This is not to be applied. Its just food for thought.
* Implementation of these techniques should be done with proper training and a lot a motivation.
* Implementing bad Agile techniques will give it a bad name and make the team fail.

## Small glossary
* Management / Business - Ren, Jules, John, Erin.
* Technical / Engineers - Me, Jim, Jay, Rob, Elliot, etc...

## A lot of info
* So I would appreciate if we could keep the questions to the end
