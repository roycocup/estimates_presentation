> I've mentioned Scrum because when we see this problem, 
Scrum seems to be particularly common as the nominative process the team is following. 
For many people, this situation is exacerbated by Scrum because Scrum is process that's centered on project management 
techniques and deliberately omits any technical practices, in contrast to (for example) Extreme Programming.
