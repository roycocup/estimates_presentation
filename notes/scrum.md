> I've mentioned Scrum because when we see this problem, 
Scrum seems to be particularly common as the nominative process the team is following. 
For many people, this situation is exacerbated by Scrum because Scrum is process that's centered on project management 
techniques and deliberately omits any technical practices, in contrast to (for example) Extreme Programming.

[Scrum is not agile by Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html)


## Why is it hard for organisations to see the difference between agile and scrum. 
1. Scrum is not agile 
2. Most of the people have done courses and completely indocrinated. 
3. Big corporate companies sell this as being the only way to build software. 
4. Quality control is not the same as feedback and quick turn around
