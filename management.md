# Management - Why do they suck

### Throwing in more people to move faster
> As the mess builds, the productivity of the team continues to decrease, asymptotically approaching zero.
As productivity decreases, management does the only thing they can; they add more staff to the project in hopes of increasing productivity. But that new staff is not versed in the design of the system. They don't know the difference between a change that matches the design intent and a change that thwarts the design intent.
Furthermore, they, and everyone else on the team, are under horrific pressure to increase productivity. So they all make more and more messes, driving the productivity ever further toward zero
