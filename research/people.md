[Alistair Cockburn - Characterizing people as Non-Linear First Order Components in Software Development](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Characterizing+people+as+non-linear%2c+first-order+components+in+software+development)

People, as active devices, have success modes and failure modes. The following are the main ones that I have named and used to date:

People are communicating beings, doing best face-to-face, in person, with real-time question and answer.
People have trouble acting consistently over time.
People are highly variable, varying from day to day and place to place.
People generally want to be good citizens, are good at looking around, taking initiative, and doing “whatever is needed” to get the project to work.
There are other characteristics that I won’t expand here:

People need both think time and communicating opportunities (see [Co98], [Cs], [Dm]).
People work well from examples (a topic for more study, however, see [J-L]).
People prefer to fail conservatively than to risk succeeding differently [Pi]; prefer to invent than to research, can only keep a small amount in their heads, and do make mistakes, and find it hard to change their habits.
Individual personalities easily dominate a project.
A person’s personality profile strongly affects their ability to perform specific assignments.
