# Quick and Dirty Development

> Quick and dirty solutions can get you part of the product early, but they may bog down afterwards. This might mean that we couldn't give our customer what they really need long term. Well-factored code can be maintained indefinitely. An XP approach may deliver more value throughout the entire project.


> Still, this is bad news for the design guys. They really can out-produce the quick guys over the long haul, but they don’t have market share. By the time they’re out, the quick guys have all the business, and at the business level, the game is all but over unless the quick guys stumble very badly.
