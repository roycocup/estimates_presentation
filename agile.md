# Agile

## Agile Manifesto
- **Individuals and Interactions** over processes and tools

- **Working Software** over comprehensive documentation

- **Customer Collaboration** over contract negotiation

- **Responding to Change** over following a plan

## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
1. We follow these principles:
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

## Explanation
- [What is it - By Ron Jeffries](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/018-01ff/agile-riff/)

- [Neal Ford and Martin Fowler - Agile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE6lbPLEAzc)
    - Its hard to take agile serious, but in the last 10 years its become the mainstream alternative (conference and certificates...)
    - (**Semantic Diffusion**) The original ideas get more and more diffuse and fuzzy as they pass on people. Some companies are employing **unrecognizable agile ideas** now as they adapt some concepts. Sometimes they have been doing agile for years and its unrecognizable. Its a common problem. The solution is reminding people of what are the core ideas of agile.
    - [The new Methodology by Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html)
    - In this last essay MF distinguishes 2 key features between agile world and plan-driven world.

## Plan-driven world
- In the plan-driven, plan is essential before starting whatever it is that you are about to do. **Plan your work, then work your plan**. A predictive approach towards planning in which the plan is a prediction of how the work should go.
- It also is the measures the success of a work, as it went according to the plan (On time and on budget).
- Useful in many situations, but **depends** on the fact that you are able to get a a **clear and stable set of requirement**
- If they are not clear, the rest of the plan is not stable. Not just the plan, but the entire software development process.
- This is a problem: Are you requirement stable? Its a minority.
- In order to stabilise they come up with all sort of techniques (sign-off, code freeze, up-front requirements, etc...)

## So...
- Maybe what we should need is to break that dependency where the entire software development process is dependent on the stability of the requirements.

## Agile World
- We can't get stable requirements. and come up with a software development process that is **tolerant** to requirement changes.
- "A late change in requirements is a competitive advantage" - Mary Poppendieck Author of Lean Software Development.
    - We should not just expect change in requirement, but that we should embrace change as it will bring competitive advantage to our clients!
    - How do we do this? We dont just plan and execute the plan. We use whats called an **Adaptative Planning** approach which means we do this cycle of planning and execution many many times on a project (iteration or sprints) and we look to release the software at regular intervals.
- In order to make Adaptative Planning work we need to change the way we thing about software design. It needs to be a **evolutionary approach**
- The design is somethngg that is also constantly evolving and changing as you go. [Lots of techniques](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html)
