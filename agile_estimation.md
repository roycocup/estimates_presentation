> Agile estimation techniques are designed to be fast (-er than traditional techniques) and deliberately trade off accuracy.  We are not trying to learn to predict the future… or get better at estimation. Instead, we recognize that estimation is a non-value added activity and minimize it as much as possible.

> Why should you care? You should care because the defects won’t show up until near the end of the project, or even after the project is released to users. Then you’ll have to do the work that should already have been done to make the code work. You should care because as the code gets worse, the work becomes more difficult and the team slows down. In addition, as the code gets worse, even more defects slip in.

> All these things result in a product that is late, delivers less than it might have, has more defects than it needed to have, and that will cost more to maintain than it should have.

> It’s not ideal to think of our product as a long list of things we must do. It’s not the best idea to predict when we’ll be done, or even project when we’ll be done. The Agile Manifesto calls for Working Software. Take the next problem, solve it with working software. Really solve it, which means getting that solution in the hands of the people who need it. It’s not about planning, predicting, and projecting. It’s about choosing, building, and providing.
